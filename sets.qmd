```{r}
genes <- paste("gene",1:1000,sep="")
x <- list(
  A = sample(genes,300), 
  B = sample(genes,525), 
  C = sample(genes,440),
  D = sample(genes,350)
  )
```

```{r}
library(ggVennDiagram)
ggVennDiagram(x, label_alpha = 0)
```

Notes: experiment -> one outcome, not multiple ones. Three coin tosses -> one outcome that is a sequence of _sequence_ 
results

Experiment -> unique outcome
Sample space should be exhaustive and mutually exclusive (if not, we could not assign a single point in the space to an outcome)
